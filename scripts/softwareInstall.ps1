.SYNOPSIS
    Installs any software package found in a specified directory.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script searches for installer files in a given directory (relative to the script's location by default). 
    It installs each found package silently, waits for each installation to complete, and then attempts to clean up any temporary files.

.PARAMETER InstallPath
    The path to the directory where the installers are located. Default is relative to the script location under `installs\`.

.PARAMETER Verbosity
    Controls the level of output shown during installation. Options:
    - `silent`: Suppress most output and run the installation in quiet mode.
    - `verbose`: Show detailed output about the installation process.
    - `force`: Perform the installation with force (overrides some checks, more aggressive).

.EXAMPLE
    .\softwareInstall.ps1
    This will run the script and install all software packages found in the `installs\` directory next to the script.

.EXAMPLE
    .\softwareInstall.ps1 -InstallPath "D:\Software\Installers" -Verbosity "verbose"
    This will run the script with a custom install path and show detailed output.
